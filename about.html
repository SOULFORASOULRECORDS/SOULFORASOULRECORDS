        <p>
          <strong>We are NOT a normal label.</strong> If you’re expecting money handed to you or instant growth, you should look elsewhere. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We, as a team and family, help each other grow together. In SOULFORASOULRECORDS, we expect professionalism and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Run by <strong>Tarell Hinds</strong>, the founder (and also an artist), he has found that many artists work against each other instead of understanding that everyone can work together to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SOULFORASOULRECORDS</strong> is not for one specific genre. Artists from all genres and people of all backgrounds, regardless of skin color, are welcome here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike most record labels, you’re not obligated to share money, and we will <strong>NOT</strong> take money from you. We and other members work together, sharing trade secrets and social media strategies with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>YOU OWE US NOTHING.</strong>
